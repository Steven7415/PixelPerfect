    <h2>Pixel Graphic History</h2>
    <p>Pixel graphics have been around since computer imaging had been exposed to the public. The cute aesthetic that these pieces give to their enthusiasts is as powerful as the medium that is used. Around 1978, during the end of the 70&rsquo;s, "Space Invaders" had become all the rage, bringing a first glimpse to the pixel graphic era that was to come. Pac Man, Galaga, and many others would soon follow. The art style has been practically wiped out due to the progression of technology. But there are still several of us who love and adore the art style still today.</p>
